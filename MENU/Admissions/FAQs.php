        <p align="justify"><a name="Q1" id="Q1"><strong>What is VDTT ?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
  VDTT stands for VLSI Design Tools and Technology. Its' a Masters program at IIT, Delhi.We'll use this acronym through out this FAQ. And if you have just heard about a VLSI course at IIT Delhi, then this is the one of them. :)   This is an interdisciplinary program jointly run by two departments, Electrical Engg and Computer Science &amp; Engg together with the Centre for Applied Research in Electronics. <br />
            <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><br />
            <p align="justify"><a name="Q2" id="Q2"><strong>How is it different from other MTech programs ?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            Its' an inter disciplinary Industry Sponsored program. Each student in this program is sponsored by a particular company. He will also get an opportunity to interact with his sponsoring company along with International career opportunities.<br />
            <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><br />
            <p align="justify"><a name="Q3" id="Q3"><strong>What is Inter disciplinary?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            This means that 3 departments Computer Science &amp; Engg, Electrical Engg and CARE ( Center for Applied Research in Electronics) participate in this program.Students will also undergo a hands-on fabrication training at CEERI, Pilani or at CARE.<br />
            <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><br />
            <p align="justify"><a name="Q4" id="Q4"><strong>I am not too comfortable with Electronics but I would like to do VLSI at the system level. Do I have a choice of subjects?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            The VDTT Program has three streams. Please refer to the <a href="../Courses.php">COURSES</a> section on website for more details.<br />
            <a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><br />
            <p align="justify"><a name="Q24" id="Q24"><strong>I am confused..?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            Never mind. This is to tell you that there is a certain amount of flexibility within the program that has been introduced to help students choose courses according to their interests. The number of core courses have been reduced and program electives have been increased to accomodate this flexibility. This gives the students a good bandwidth to choose from a variety of courses.<br />
              <a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br /><br />
              <br />
              <a name="Q25" id="Q25"><strong>How do I decide which stream to choose?</strong>    </a><br />
            Students with a stronger Computer Science background would generally prefer the Systems Stream whereas those who prefer hardcore electronics design would find themselves comfortable with the Design stream. This criteria is not binding on the students.<br />

              <br />
              <a name="Q26" id="Q26"><strong>Do I have to decide the stream before the interviews?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            Although this is not required, you could mention your interests during the interview.<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="Q6" id="Q6"><strong>Do I have to work for the Assistantship which I get?</strong>    </a><br />
            Yes, just like any other ME/MTech program student. This will involve, approximately eight hours/week of teaching assistantship work which will be assigned to you after you join the course.<br />

            You will be doing your final semester project with your sponsor and a faculty member from the VDTT group. This project will be decided during the second semester. The project location is at the sponsors' location. Areas of interests can be mentioned by the sponsor during the admission time. Also you may get some sort of trainnig in between the course by the sponsoring company.<br />
                <a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br /><br />
              <br />

            <a name="Q16" id="Q16"><strong>What's the selection procedure?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            Good question. Lets' take time and try to understand this.<br /></p>
                <ol>
                  <li>First you will have to procure the admission forms (Regular ME/MTech Admission-forms issued by IIT, Delhi).</li>
                    <li>You make sure that the duly completed form reaches the institute before the specified deadline.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the number of applications received that year a particular number of students will be short listed for the interviews while a few students may be selected for direct admission. You will be intimated about these things if you meet the basic requirements and any of criteria given below:</li>
                    <li>Exceptional GATE Score with more than 75 % aggregate in the qualifying degree you may be eligible for Direct Admission. This means that you will not be attending the first round of interviews.</li>
                    <li>A GATE score above a certain cutoff decided based on the number of applications received that year you will be called for the first round of interviews.</li>
                    <li>You will be intimated about the date and the venue for the interview.</li>
                    <li>On the specified day you attend the interview along with other candidates. This will be conducted by the VDTT faculty only and based on the performance of the candidates, few of them will be short listed for the second round of interview. This list will be announced on the same day as soon as all the candidates are interviewed.</li>
                    <li>The previously short listed students along with the direct admission candidates will have to meet the representatives from the sponsoring companies. Usually each representative presents ideas and areas of interest about his company. This will help you to provide options for the company you want to be sponsored by.</li>
                    <li>Depending on your options you will be interviewed by the sponsor. Based on your performance and choice you will be selected and alloted a particular sponsor.</li>
            </ol>
                <p>Hope that more or less clears the procedure! .<br />

                  <a name="Q17" id="Q17"><strong>Interviews ? What preparation or background do I need?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            Relax. You just need fundamentals of your qualifying degree.No experience or background regarding VLSI will be assumed.<br />

                            <a name="Q19" id="Q19"><strong>Do you have any other statistics?</strong>    </a><br /><br />
            In year 2015, 6 students were admitted into the program. Of the total intake Cypress sponsored 1 student,Texas Instruments 1 and Cadence sponsored 1 and 3 were sponsored by Internal Projects<br />
